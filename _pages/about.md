I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Intelligent Transportation at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn), Guangzhou, where I am jointly supervised by Prof. [Huan Yu](https://amslab.org) and Prof. [Mamadou Diagne](https://www.insync-lab.org)(UCSD). 
Prior to my time at HKUST(GZ), I received the M.S. degree in Vehicle Engineering from the South China University of Technology([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/)) in 2022, and my B.E. degree in Vehicle Engineering from SouthWest University([SWU](https://www.swu.edu.cn)) in 2019.

My research interests lie at the **boundary control** of partial differential equations(PDEs) and the combination of learning-based control methods with PDEs, particularly in the applicaiton of **intelligent transportation systems**. I fouces on desiging the robust controller for PDEs with markov-jumping parameters and incorporating **neural operators**
to accelerate the implmentation of control methods with theorectial guarantees.

During my Ph.D. studies, I work closely with Prof. [Jean Auriol(CNRS)](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/auriol-jean/) on the stabilization of PDEs with markov-jumping parameters, we also developed the neural operator(NO)-based backstepping controller to stabilize the stochastic PDEs.
